The ``main`` branch is the deployment ready branch with all main changes that have been checked and double checked.

The `development` branch is for all development changes. When the developers create and confirm changes. These changes will be pushed to this branch. This will be the version of the app that will be checked and double checked before being added to `main`.

The `front-end` branch is for all front-end changes. Every new feature or page will be created here and have its own branches created. e.g. You create a branch within `front-end` called `home-page` and design and prototype the home page for an app and once everything is validated and double checked. The changes will be merged with `front-end`.

The `back-end` branch is selft explanatory. For all new back-end features. They will have a branch made here, coded, tested, validated and refined. Once that unit has been tested. It will be merged with `back-end`.

The `documentation` branch is mainly for developmental documentation. This is not for collaborators to work with unless instructed to. These are for project planning, design, and all details.
